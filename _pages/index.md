## Introduction

Hi, my name is Nick. I'm a technical artist from Belarus. I've been working in the game industry for more than 9 years, more than half of this time I worked as a 3D artist. I decided to learn C++ to push my career and work at a deeper level with tool creation.

## Strengths

Strong problem solving skills.

## Weakness

Lack of strong programming skills.

## Accomplishments

I think my biggest accomplishment for now is relocation to the Netherlands as a highly skilled migrant.

## Hobbies

Motorcycle trips, DIY, playing video games, watching movies. Lately, I have enjoyed old science fiction movies like Blade Runner, Johnny Mnemonic, The 6th Day, Total Recall, etc. One of my favorite games it's Half-Life, but the last one that impressed me in terms of world transformations - is Layers of Fear.

## Career Goals

Become more professional as a technical artist. Improve my programming skills, it's almost the only one that I lack to be a solo developer :)
